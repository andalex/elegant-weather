# Elegant Weather Dev TODO

[ ] Work on NPM and publishing stuff
[ ] Infra for storing API secret (AWS Secrets manager w Lambda ?)
[ ] Fix issue where API is only returning 3 days of forecast no matter how many days are in the query
[ ] Componetize better -- break apart common layout components, and better organize the app structure. Consider common props perhaps? since Ink is so declarative
[ ] Show time and date in the app
[ ] Add precip. warnings (i.e. No rain for the next hour / Rain starting for the next 60min)
[ ] Add weather alerts section (NOAA alerts);
[ ] Add tests
[ ] Roadmap MVP Features, and post MVP features.
[ ] Cleanup emoji box rendering issue
[ ] Add expandable panels
